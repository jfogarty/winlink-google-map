Well dang; we likely won't get to see you two till early next year. We should get to La Cruz about the same time, though, so that will be fun. San Carlos is a very pretty place, but it's fairly dead in the off season. We mostly stuck around the little condo, where John kept busy by doing programming and science courses online (Coursera.)He also has a big programming project he's been working on....he's quite happy just doing exactly what interests him. I did one, too, just for entertainment purposes. Our kindle book collection swelled enormously, too, thanks to the crew of Cavale. They were here for a short time before trucking their boat to Texas. We have decent wifi; this has kept our bittorrent kitty stocked up! Not much else to do here without a car. We have made friends with a fellow condo dweller, though, and she has driven us around a bit to see more of the area, and had us over for games and dinner and such. And yes, there have been a handful of nasty thunderstorms, with enough rain to wash salt off the boats. Most of the storms are east of here, though, and travel up toward Tucson; they must get way more rain than I would have imagined for the desert. 

We'll be excited to meet up with you and compare grand plans; ours are taking shape but as always, open to change. Take care and have a great Fall!

Cheers,

Mary and John
